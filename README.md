# Work Sample

## What youâ€™ll be doing
You will be creating an application form for a fictitious school. This form will let our school accept applications from companies that want to attend their courses.

Each course is available at different dates. All applications must be saved in a database and contains the following:

- Course ID
- Course date
- Company name
- Company phone number
- Company e-mail

## Expectations
We expect you to create this signup flow using Microsoft .NET Core, C# and other related technologies for the backend.
Define a suitable database structure, and use suitable design patterns throughout.
The finished work sample should have a readme describing how to get the application up and running.

## Delivery
We want you to return your work to us in the following way:

- **The code**:
	- can be hosted as a repository on Github or similar GIT based service under your own profile.
	Then share the project with us by inviting these credentials:
		username:deanzhivkovskicodeit
		email:dean.zhivkovski@codeit.mk
	OR
	- send it on this mail: dean.zhivkovski@codeit.mk


When we meet, we want you to show us the code and talk about why you've made choices regarding framework, data structure, architecture and how you approached the work.

## Resources
The courses are available as json in the endpoints folder.

## If you have time
The following items are not required but if you have the time feel free to implement (parts of) them. We will review these extras in the same way we review the base work sample.

- Frontend of the app:
 - you can use any frontend technology like React, Angular and other SPAs or even simple Razor pages for a non SPA experience.
 - Design is available in the design folder.
 - The font is Source Sans Pro: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro
- **API with endpoints:** Expose the data/applications through an API (documented with e.g. Swagger) so that the school's other IT-systems can consume them.

## Hint
You can use Postman or any other tool to test the endpoints OR if you have implemented some API documentation like Swagger you can use that.

## Have fun!
This test is not about pointing fingers or say you did something wrong. We want to see how you think and how you implement a common task into code.

## Questions
If you have any questions, you can ask them in the Discord channel for .Net or send me a mail on: dean.zhivkovski@codeit.mk
